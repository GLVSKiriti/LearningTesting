Step1 === Intall Jest with (npm i --save-dev jest)
Step2 === Change the test script to "jest"

toBe matcher:

The toBe matcher performs a strict equality comparison (===) between the actual and expected values.
It checks if the actual and expected values are the same instance in memory (same reference) for objects and arrays.
For primitive values (numbers, strings, booleans), it compares the values directly.

toEqual matcher:

The toEqual matcher performs a deep equality comparison between the actual and expected values.
It recursively compares the values of nested objects and arrays, ensuring they have the same properties/elements and values.
It does not require the actual and expected values to be the same instances in memory.
It is more suitable for comparing complex objects and arrays.

*****************Coverage

add in scripts jest --coverage instead of jest 
so you can see the code coverage
